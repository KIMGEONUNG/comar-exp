## What if we optimize the original image have zero image gradient or laplaceian?

For the original sample image, 

<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIMGEONUNG/comar-exp/main/experments/zero_grad_laplace/sample_gray.jpg" width = "350">

The animation below shows the process of optimization targeting zero image gradient.

## Consideration

The experiemnt oprimizing the image gradient to zero results in watercolor painting effect.
On the other hand, the experiment using laplacian shows blurry effect such as gaussian blur.
