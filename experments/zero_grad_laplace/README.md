## What if we optimize the original image have zero image gradient or laplaceian?

For the original sample image, 
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KIMGEONUNG/comar-exp/main/experments/zero_grad_laplace/sample_gray.jpg" width = "350">

The image below is the animation showing the process of optimization targeting zero image gradient.
